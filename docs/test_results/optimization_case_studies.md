# Optimization Case Studies

This document presents real-world case studies showing how PyPerfOptimizer has been used to identify and solve performance bottlenecks in different application domains. Each case study demonstrates the comprehensive approach of using multiple profilers together to achieve significant optimization.

## Case Study 1: E-commerce Product Recommendation System

### Initial Problem

An e-commerce platform was experiencing slow response times when rendering product recommendation sections. Customer analytics showed that 27% of users were abandoning the page before recommendations fully loaded, resulting in missed sales opportunities.

The recommendation engine was processing user behavior data, purchase history, and product relationships to generate personalized recommendations for each user.

### Profiling Approach

The development team used PyPerfOptimizer to analyze the performance of their recommendation engine:

1. **CPU Profiler**: Identified function call patterns and hotspots
2. **Memory Profiler**: Tracked memory usage throughout the recommendation process
3. **Line Profiler**: Pinpointed exact code lines causing the performance issues

### Key Findings
