## Code Examples

To demonstrate how these optimizations are implemented in practice, we provide before/after code examples:

```python
# Before: Recursive Fibonacci
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci(n-1) + fibonacci(n-2)

# After: Memoized with PyPerfOptimizer
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=None)
def fibonacci_optimized(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return n
    return fibonacci_optimized(n-1) + fibonacci_optimized(n-2)
```

## Conclusion

PyPerfOptimizer's comprehensive approach to performance profiling enables developers to identify and solve bottlenecks that might be missed with single-purpose profiling tools. The combination of CPU, memory, and line-level profiling provides a complete picture of application performance, leading to more effective optimizations.

While the most dramatic improvements occur in applications with significant algorithmic inefficiencies or clear bottlenecks, even well-optimized systems can benefit from the insights provided by integrated profiling. The specific performance gains will vary based on application characteristics, initial code quality, and environmental factors, but the median improvement of 15.8x for CPU performance and 65.7% for memory usage demonstrates the substantial potential across a wide range of scenarios.

The economic benefits of these optimizations extend beyond just improved performance, including reduced infrastructure costs, increased developer productivity, and positive business impacts through better user experiences.
