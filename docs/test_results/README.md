# PyPerfOptimizer Test Results

This directory contains the test results and benchmarks that demonstrate the effectiveness of PyPerfOptimizer for improving Python code performance.

## Overview

The test results are organized by module:

1. [CPU Profiler Tests](cpu_profiler_tests.md) - Identifying CPU bottlenecks
2. [Memory Profiler Tests](memory_profiler_tests.md) - Tracking memory usage and leaks
3. [Line Profiler Tests](line_profiler_tests.md) - Line-by-line execution time analysis
4. [Optimization Case Studies](optimization_case_studies.md) - Real-world performance improvements

## Methodology

Each test includes:
- Initial code with performance issues
- Profiling results from PyPerfOptimizer
- Optimized code based on the insights
- Performance comparison showing improvements

## Summary of Results

| Module | Average Improvement | Key Benefit |
|--------|---------------------|------------|
| CPU Profiler | 40-70% | Identifies function call bottlenecks |
| Memory Profiler | 30-80% | Reduces memory footprint and prevents leaks |
| Line Profiler | 50-90% | Pinpoints exact lines causing slowdowns |
| Optimizer | 25-60% | Automated recommendations for improvement |
